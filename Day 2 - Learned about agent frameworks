# Day 2 — Agent Frameworks

Today I learned that AI agents are usually not built from scratch.
Developers use agent frameworks that provide ready-made components like memory, tools, and planning systems.

These frameworks help agents move from answering questions to actually completing tasks.

Main frameworks I explored:
- AutoGen → enables multiple agents to collaborate
- Semantic Kernel → helps build AI applications using functions and memory
- Azure AI Agent Service → used to deploy and scale agents

          AutoGen
     (Agent teamwork)

              ↓

       Semantic Kernel
        (Build apps)

              ↓

     Azure Agent Service
        (Deploy & scale)


Key takeaway:
AI is shifting from prompt-response systems to goal-driven systems.
